## Gym Workouts

- The reason why i choose gym workouts as a topic is to let other people know what works for me and helps me have a good workout. Another reason i choose this topic is to help others have an understanding of the workouts and which muscles are being activated. In addition, i chose this topic is because i like to weightlift and want to help other people how to weightlift.

## Typography Enhacement
- Some typography features i added on the h1 is the text center and spreaded out more to show, so it can be the main focus. As for the h2 and below i made it text align to the left and made it thinner but not smaller than the paragraph. So it wont be see as the same level as the paragraph or content inside it. 
- `:hover` and `:foucs`
    - As for my links i made the underline disappear so it can clean. Another thing i added was on the `nav li` i added `display: inline-block` so the navigation would be horizontal. Then, i styled it with with a `background-color` and `border-radius`. So, when it hovers or focus it block yellow would appear on it.

## Decorative or Positional Enhancement
- `position: sticky`
    - The positional enhancement i put on web page is the `position: sticky;` which is a scroll-based element on the nav menu and is at the top of page, `top: 0px;`.  
- `position: fixed`
    - I used the `fixed` position on the footer and added `right:0` and `bottom: 0` so it can stayed at the bottom right. this makes the footer make appear always at the bottom right when scrolling.

## Phase 3 Overview
- I think my flexbox and grid layout are not what i wanted them to be but it is start and as i coded along i was learning more how to use. I use the the flexbox in the first section on index
- Then, i used the grid layout on the section two and three but where i alternated the paragraph and heading to be. 

## New Supage
- For the new subpage content i added, why stay active? and just explained the importance of staying active and just talked about one topic. Which was walking and then added three bulletpoints in the right side of the page. 
- I used the grid layout for this new supage on the main content. As for the header and footer it was just flexbox.

## Image Optimazation
- As for the image optimization i used it on the index.html and active.html. However it came out different on the two file. The image was larger than expected in index.html than active.html. For the active.html it was normal size but it didn't stayed within the grid layout as i switch to different dimension on the screen.
