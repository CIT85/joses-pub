            <h3>List of Activities</h3>
            
            <p>Staying active throughout the day is essential for maintaining overall health because it boosts circulation, prevents muscle stiffness, and reduces the risks linked to prolonged sitting, such as heart disease, diabetes, and back pain. Regular movement enhances metabolism, helping with weight management, while also improving mood, energy levels, and mental clarity by increasing oxygen flow and releasing endorphins. Additionally, staying active supports joint flexibility, strengthens muscles, and promotes better sleep, contributing to long-term well-being and longevity. Small, consistent actions—like walking, stretching, or taking the stairs—add up, making daily activity just as important as structured workouts for a healthier, more vibrant life.</p>

                <figcaption>Walking is highly beneficial for both physical and mental health. It strengthens the heart, improves circulation, and helps maintain a healthy weight by burning calories. Regular walking also boosts mood, reduces stress, and enhances mental clarity by releasing endorphins. Additionally, it supports joint health, increases mobility, and lowers the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension. Simple yet effective, walking is an accessible way to improve overall well-being.</figcaption>
