            <h2>Stretches</h2>

                <p>
                Stretching is highly beneficial for both <mark>physical</mark> and <mark>mental</mark> well-being. It improves flexibility, increases range of motion, and reduces the risk of injuries by preparing muscles for activity and relieving tension. Regular stretching enhances blood circulation, promoting faster recovery and reducing muscle soreness after workouts. It also helps correct posture by lengthening tight muscles that pull areas of the body out of alignment. Additionally, stretching can alleviate stress by releasing endorphins and relaxing tense muscles, making it a great way to unwind mentally. Whether done dynamically before exercise or statically afterward, incorporating stretching into a daily routine supports overall mobility, reduces stiffness, and contributes to long-term joint and muscle health.
